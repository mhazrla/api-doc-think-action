# Completed Goals

As the name suggests, Completed Goals are a core part of Protocol — the very reason Protocol exists is so you can have secure conversations with your Completed Goals. On this page, we'll dive into the different Completed Goals endpoints you can use to manage Completed Goals programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete Completed Goals.
